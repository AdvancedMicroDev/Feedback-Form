Feedback : Awesome session! Learned something new, about gitHub and about OpenSource. It is a great platform to contribute and an amazing opportunity to learn, practice 
           and level up the coding game. Thanks Jay and Rohan. I could not attend at the start due to power cut, but I enjoyed the session either way and the fun quiz at 
           the end!
